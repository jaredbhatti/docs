Installing on Google Cloud
==========================

.. warning::

  To use this setup, you must able to link a domain name to the machine's IP address. If you donâ€™t own a domain, services such as `FreeDNS <https://freedns.afraid.org>`_ offer free sub-domains under a range of domains.

.. tip::

  If you are new to Google Cloud, you will need to `create a Google Cloud Platform project <https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-resource-manager>`_ and make sure `billing is enabled <https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project>`_. 

.. tip::

  Google Cloud offers a `Free Tier<https://cloud.google.com/free/>`_ of service for Compute Engine, limited to certain regions and instance sizes. For more information read the `Free Tier FAQ<https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/gcp-free-tier>`_. 

Create an instance
------------------

1. Go to the `GCP Compute Engine Dashboard <https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances>`_.

2. Click on :guilabel:`Create`.

3. In the :guilabel:`Name` text box, enter `aggregate` (or your desired name).

4. Select the desired region and zone.

    Choose a region that's close to the location where data is going to be collected.

5. Select the instance type you want to use.

    A minimum setup is a `small` instance type (1 vCPU, 1.7 GB of memory), but you should review your requirements and choose a bigger instance type according to your needs.

6. Click on :guilabel:`Change` under the :guilabel:`Boot disk` section.

7. Select :guilabel:`Ubuntu 18.04 LTS`.

8. Set the desired storage size for your VM, and click :guilabel:`Select`.

    A minimum setup is 30 GB of storage, but you should review your requirements and adjust the value of the `Size (GiB)` field according to your needs.

9. Under the :guilabel:`Firewall` section, check :guilabel:`Allow HTTP traffic`, and :guilabel:`Allow HTTPS traffic`.

10. Expand the :guilabel:`Management, security, disks, networking, sole tenancy` section.

11. In the :guilabel:`Management` tab, under :guilabel:`Automation`, copy the contents of `this startup script <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opendatakit/aggregate/master/cloud-config/google-cloud/startup-script.sh>`_ into the :guilabel:`Startup script` text box.

12. In the :guilabel:`Networking` tab, set the :guilabel:`Hostname` with the domain name (e.g., your.domain) you want to use for Aggregate. This hostname will be used by the startup script to configure your instance's HTTPS support.

13. Click on :guilabel:`Create`.


Set up your domain
------------------

.. warning:: GCP instances use ephemeral IP addresses which can change under certain circumstances. To ensure your Aggregate install will always be reachable using the same IP address, you can promote the ephemeral IP address to a static IP address using `these instructions <https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/ip-addresses/reserve-static-external-ip-address#promote_ephemeral_ip>`_.

1. Go to the `GCP - VM Instances <https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances>`_ page and find your instance.

2. Take note of the IP address (e.g., 12.34.56.78) in the :guilabel:`External IP` column and set a *DNS A record* pointing to it.

    If you own a domain, check your domain registrar's instructions. If you don't own a domain, we recommend using `FreeDNS <https://freedns.afraid.org>`_ to get a free sub-domain.

    Your domain's *TTL* setting will affect to how much time you will have to wait until you can proceed to the next step. If your provider gives you the option of setting a TTL, use the lowest value you can.

3.  Open a web browser, and periodically check the domain until you see the Aggregate website. You won't be able to continue the install until you see the website load.


Enable HTTPS
------------

1. In `GCP - VM Instances <https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances>`_ page, SSH into your VM clicking the :guilabel:`SSH` button in the :guilabel:`External IP` column.

2. Once you are logged in, run :command:`sudo certbot run --nginx --non-interactive --agree-tos -m YOUR_EMAIL --redirect -d YOUR_DOMAIN`. 

    Be sure to replace YOUR_EMAIL and YOUR_DOMAIN with your email address and your domain.

    Lets Encrypt uses the email you provide to send notifications about expiration of certificates.


Log into Aggregate
------------------

1. Go to https://your.domain and check that Aggregate is running.

2. Login and change the administrator account's password!
